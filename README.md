# COVID-19 Testing Locations Finder.
Website to help people find nearest COVID-19 testing locations in the U.S. Simply select a state and enter your zip code to see testing locations near you.

This prototype site is for the Girls in Tech 2020 Hackathon. [Link to Hackathon](https://girls-in-tech-hackathon.devpost.com/)



## Features

This website allows people to convently access all the information needed to find the best testing site for their needs. 

## Tools used 

Azure cloud platform

API to get locations information: [COVID-19 API Testing Locations](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/SzS7PR3t?version=latest)

API to get distance between zip codes: [Zip Code Distance](https://www.zipcodeapi.com/)

## Future Improvements

* Add more states
* Add more information about availability (days of the week and times each location is open)
* Find a more accurate way to get distance from locations (sorting by zip code distance isn't a great estimate and current API being used limits calls)
